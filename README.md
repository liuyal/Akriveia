## Background

Over the last couple of decades urban centers around the world have faced substantial population
growth. As a result, the number of larger and more complex commercial structures in core urban
centers around the world is rapidly increasing. With a large population and massively complex
buildings in relatively small areas, the potential impact of damages and casualties in the event of a disaster have greatly increased as well. Due to increased urbanization and complexity of urban structures, search and rescue operations in indoor urban environments face various complications and uncertainties. According to Statistics Canada, an average of 135 re related deaths occur each year from 2010 to 2014 [1].
