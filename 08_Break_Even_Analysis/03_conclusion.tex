\section{Conclusion}

\bigskip
As a product that could potentially affect the outcome of disaster relief operations, the Akriveia
Beacon is designed with the utmost care. As aforementioned, TRIWAVE SYSTEMS is dedicated
to create a reliable and robust system design to improve disaster search and rescue operations
with human safety as the pivotal focus.

\bigskip
In order for the Akriveia Beacon system to become a successful and economically sustainable product, a break-even analysis was performed to categorising production costs between those which are variable and those that are fixed. The break-even point is key in determining TRIWAVE SYSTEMSâ€™ financial plan; by calculating the fixed and variable costs for the product, the minimum product units needed to be sold at a given price point to break-even can be obtained. This is an integral part of budgeting process which includes any business and operational cost and will be important for the company to continue development and production.

\bigskip
However, it should also be noted that the break-even analysis should not act as a predictor of demand.
If the current market does not have high demand or the product goes into the market with the wrong price or wrong target audience, it will be very difficult to ever hit the break-even point. Which is why it is also critical to understand the current markets and to develop a strong Market Entry Strategies. This will allow for TRIWAVE SYSTEMS to become successful and is an important factor for investment recognition.
