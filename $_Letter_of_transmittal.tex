\opening{Dear Dr. Scratchley and Dr. Rawicz,} 
 
The following document contains the Requirement Specification for Disaster Victim Location System created by GROUPNAME. The Disaster Victim Location System focuses on locating personals trapped in buildings during small scale disasters. This is achieved by incorporating an combination of advanced radio modules and microcontrollers to create an dependable indoor positioning system. We believe our system allows search and rescue professionals to reliably locate victims during an emergency or disaster without risking their safety.

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description for the overall system architect and requirements of the product according to the different development stages (proof-of-concept- prototype, and final product). This document consists of a system overview, system requirements, engineering standards, as well as safety and sustainability overviews.

GROUPNAME is composed of five dedicated and talented senior engineering students. The members include Keith Leung, Jeffery Yeung, Scott Checko, Ryne Watterson, and Jerry Liu. Coming
from various engineering concentrations with a diverse set of skills and expenices, we believe that our product will truly provide a layer of safety and reliability to search and rescue operations.

Thank you for taking the time to review our requirement specifications document. If there are any further questions or comments, please direct them to our Chief Communications Officer Jeffery Yeung at zjyeung@sfu.ca

Sincerely,\\
Jerry Liu\\
Chief Executive Officer\\
