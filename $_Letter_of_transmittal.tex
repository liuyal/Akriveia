\opening{Dear Dr. Scratchley and Dr. Rawicz,} 
 
\medskip
The following document contains the Requirement Specification for Akrivia Beacon - The Indoor Location Rescue System created by TRIWAVE SYSTEMS. The Akrivia Beacon focuses on locating personals trapped in buildings during small scale disasters such as fires and low magnitude earthquakes. This is achieved by incorporating an combination of advanced Ultra-wide-band radio modules and microcontrollers to create an dependable indoor positioning system using trilateration. We believe our system allows search and rescue operator to safely and reliably locate victims during an emergency or disaster.

\medskip
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description for the overall system architect and requirements of the product according to the different development stages (proof-of-concept- prototype, and final product). This document consists of a system overview, system requirements, engineering standards, as well as safety and sustainability overviews.

\medskip
TRIWAVE SYSTEMS is composed of five dedicated and talented senior engineering students. The members include Keith Leung, Jeffrey Yeung, Scott Checko, Ryne Watterson, and Jerry Liu. Coming from various engineering concentrations with a diverse set of skills and expenices, we believe that our product will truly provide a layer of safety and reliability to search and rescue operations.

\medskip
Thank you for taking the time to review our requirement specifications document. If there are any further questions or comments, please direct them to our Chief Communications Officer Jeffrey Yeung at zjyeung@sfu.ca
