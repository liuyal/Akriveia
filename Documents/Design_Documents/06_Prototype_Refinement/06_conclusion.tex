As a company TRIWAVE SYSTEMS is focused on creating the most reliable and accurate indoor location rescue system. As aforementioned, Akriveia Beacon is a system of Ultra-WideBand (UWB) radio beacons and ID tag systems communicating via UWB and using trilateration to accurately obtain near real-time location of personnel within buildings during the event of a disaster. The location information which then can be reported to emergency responders and operators to provide accurate and reliable information for the search and rescue effort.

The most efficient way to test and ensure new designs work as desired is through prototyping and product refinement. Since the product is designed and developed in three phases: proof-of-concept phase, prototype phase, and final product phase there are plenty of opportunity to improve system functions and design. Throughout each phase of development design changes and optimizations are made to ensure quality and reliability of the final product. As a system that could be critical for first and rescue operations, it is crucial that a reliable and robust system design can be improved upon to better aid disaster search and rescue operations with human safety as the pivotal focus.
