\subsection{Costs \& Expense Forecasting}
In the following tables, the money that has already been put into the project, and the estimated costs for the remainder of the project are outlined. The expenses are divided into two tables, one containing the expenses already incurred up to the time of this writing, and the other contains a forecast of the expected costs to come.
