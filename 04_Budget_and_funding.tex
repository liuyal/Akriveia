\subsection{Budget Estimation}
\medskip

For the Alpha phase of the project, the team plans to test a few transceivers from different manufacturers in order to find the most suitable transceivers for the final prototype. For the microcontroller unit, the ESP32 development board will be used to help test these transceivers with the system. In the following tables, expense that has already been put into the project, and the estimated costs for the remainder of the project are outlined. The expenses are divided into two tables, one containing the expenses already incurred up to the time of this writing, and the other contains a forecast of the expected costs to come.

\subsection{Product Pricing}
\medskip
The Akriveia Beacon as a product will offer its customers 10 ID Tags with 3 Beacons which additional beacons and ID tags available for purchase at unit and bulk price. The final system will have an estimated system component cost of around \$575. Along with an estimated labor and overhead cost the required final product sale price is estimated to be around \$930 with a 20\% return on sales.

\subsection{Prospective Funding Sources}
\medskip
\subsubsection{Engineering Science Student Endowment Fund}
\medskip
We hope to obtain funding from the SFU Engineering Science Student Society (\Gls{ESSS}) by means of the endowment fund set up by the society (ESSEF). We know that they have been very generous with Capstone groups in the past, so as soon as we are able to, we will be applying for funding from the ESSEF. We acknowledge that some parts purchased with the money from this source may have to be donated to the ESSS for their parts library.

\subsubsection{Wighton Development Fund}
\medskip
The Wighton Development Fund is in place to support SFU student-led projects, awarded by Dr. Andrew Rawicz \cite{R4-1}, and a comitee consisting of other facuty or staff. We hope to obtain funding that will cover the remainder of the expenses endured during this project. As with the ESSEF, an application will be submitted by this group as soon as possible.

\subsubsection{Team Contributions}
\medskip
If the above funding sources are insufficient to cover the costs of this project, each team member will agree to personal contributions up to \$50 each to complete funding for the project and cover any remaining expenses.
