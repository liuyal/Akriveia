\opening{Dear Dr. Scratchley and Dr. Rawicz,}

\medskip
The following document contains the Requirement Specifications for Akriveia Beacon - The Indoor Location Rescue System created by TRIWAVE SYSTEMS. The Akriveia Beacon focuses on locating persons trapped in buildings during small scale disasters such as fires and low magnitude earthquakes. This is achieved by incorporating a combination of advanced Ultra-wide-band radio modules and microcontrollers to create a dependable indoor positioning system using trilateration. We believe our system aids search and rescue operators by allowing them to safely and reliably locate victims during an emergency or disaster.

\medskip
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description for the overall system architecture and requirements of the product according to the different development stages (proof-of-concept- prototype, and final product). This document consists of a system overview, system requirements, engineering standards, as well as safety and sustainability overviews.

\medskip
TRIWAVE SYSTEMS is composed of five dedicated and talented senior engineering students. The members are Keith Leung, Jeffrey Yeung, Scott Checko, Ryne Watterson, and Jerry Liu. Coming from various engineering concentrations with a diverse set of skills and experiences, we believe that our product will truly provide a layer of safety and reliability to search and rescue operations.

\medskip
Thank you for taking the time to review our requirement specifications document. If there are any further questions or comments, please direct them to our Chief Communications Officer Jeffrey Yeung at zjyeung@sfu.ca

\medskip
Sincerely,\\
Jerry Liu\\
Chief Executive Officer\\
