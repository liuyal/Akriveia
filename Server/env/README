# The scripts in this folder are designed to provide a deterministic way of reproducing the rasperry pi environment.

# The scripts assume the rasperry pi has raspbian lite installed(full or recommended versions will also likely work just as well).
# after installing the OS on the pi:
# - navigate to the pi subfolder
	cd pi
# - Execute the install script as root
# - Execute the setup script as the user that will execute the akriveia rust server in production and, on any other user that needs it.
# - execute the command:
	source ~/.cargo/env

# On the development environment (such as a debian/ubuntu vm), run similar commands.
# - navigate to the host subfolder
	cd host
# - Execute the install script as root
# - Execute the setup script as the user that will execute the akriveia rust server in production and, on any other user that needs it.
# - execute the command:
	source ~/.cargo/env
