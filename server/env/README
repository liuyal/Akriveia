# The scripts in thise folder are designed to provide a deterministic way of reproducing the rasperry pi environment.

# The scripts assume the rasperry pi has raspbian lite installed(full or recommended versions will also likely work just as well).
# after installing the OS:
# - Execute the install script as root
# - Execute the setup script as the user that will execute the akriveia rust server in production and, on any other user that needs it.
