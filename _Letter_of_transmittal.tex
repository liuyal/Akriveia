\opening{Dear Dr. Scratchley and Dr. Rawicz,} 
 
 \bigskip
The following document contains the Project Proposal for the Akriveia Beacon - The Indoor Location Rescue System created by TRIWAVE SYSTEMS. The Akriveia Beacon focuses on locating personnel trapped in buildings during small scale disasters such as fires and low magnitude earthquakes. This is achieved by incorporating a combination of advanced Ultra-wideband radio modules and microcontrollers to create a dependable indoor positioning system using trilateration methods. We believe our system allows search and rescue operator to safely and reliably locate victims during an emergency or disaster. Therefore, lowering the search a rescue time and increasing the chances of rescue and survival for trapped victims.

\bigskip
In the attached project proposal provides an overview of the Akriveia Beacon system  as well as present the scope, risks, and benefit analysis of the product. It will then examine current market and potential competitions and discuss project budget, funding and cost considerations. Furthermore, an overview of the timeline and planned schedule for the Alpha and Beta phases of this project is presented, and lastly, a brief introduction to the project team members will be provided.

\bigskip
TRIWAVE SYSTEMS is composed of five dedicated and talented senior engineering students. The members include Keith Leung, Jeffrey Yeung, Scott Checko, Ryne Watterson, and Jerry Liu. Coming from various engineering backgrounds with a diverse set of skills and experiences, we believe that our product will truly provide a layer of safety and reliability to search and rescue operations.

\bigskip
Thank you for taking the time to review our project proposal document. If there are any further questions or comments, please direct them to our Chief Communications Officer Jeffrey Yeung at zjyeung@sfu.ca

Sincerely,\\
Jerry Liu\\
Chief Executive Officer\\
