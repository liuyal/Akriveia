\opening{Dear Dr. Scratchley and Dr. Rawicz,} 

\medskip
The following document contains the Design Specification for Akriveia Beacon - The Indoor Location Rescue System created by TRIWAVE SYSTEMS. The Akriveia Beacon focuses on locating personnel trapped in buildings during small scale disasters such as fires and low magnitude earthquakes. This is achieved by incorporating an combination of advanced Ultra-wide-band radio modules and microcontrollers to create an dependable indoor positioning system using trilateration. We believe our system allows search and rescue operator to safely and reliably locate victims during an emergency or disaster.

\medskip
The purpose of this document is to provide low and high-level design specifications regarding the overall system architecture, functionality and implementation of the Akriveia Beacon system. The system will be presented according to three different development stages: proof-of-concept, prototype, and final product. This document consists of system overview, system design, hardware design, electrical design, software design and as well as a detailed test plans for the Alpha and Beta products.

\medskip
TRIWAVE SYSTEMS is composed of five dedicated and talented senior engineering students. The members include Keith Leung, Jeffrey Yeung, Scott Checko, Ryne Watterson, and Jerry Liu. Each member came from various engineering concentrations and with a diverse set of skills and experiences, we believe that our product will truly provide a layer of safety and reliability to emergency search and rescue operations.

\medskip
Thank you for taking the time to review our design specifications document. If there are any further questions or comments, please direct them to our Chief Communications Officer Jeffrey Yeung at zjyeung@sfu.ca

Sincerely,\\
Jerry Liu\\
Chief Executive Officer\\
