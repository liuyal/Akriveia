\section{Engineering Standards}
\bigskip

The Akriveia Beacon will be designed and optimized to meet various engineering standards published by the IEEE, the IEC, the ISO, and the CSA Group to ensure performance and safety of the final product. The system contains electronics devices, software stack, and communication devices with different protocols, which must follow the specific safety standards. Ranging and data communication on the physical, data link, and network layer with the use of 2.4GHz WiFi and the ultra-wideband spectrum, operating in unlicensed frequency bands, and wireless standards that apply to the operation band must be followed. Furthermore, the Akriveia Beacon system is designed to operate during disaster situations, material, safety, and design must follow the structural and durability standards for disaster equipment.
