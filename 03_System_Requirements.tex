\section{System Requirements}
To produce a high-quality product, there are many requirements that must be met from all aspects of technology. This device will perform in the desired way when the software and hardware are robust and reliable. \textbf{TRIWAVE SYSTEMS} has decided that the following requirements, when met, will ensure that this product will be an asset to all first responders that use it, in as many emergency situations as possible. \textbf{TRIWAVE SYSTEMS} puts a high price on safety, reliability, and ease of use, so that this product may help save lives and keep first responders safe. The functionalities that are labeled with a '\textbf{P}', as Prototype, will be presented at the end of ENSC 405W.

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}
In order for this product to be successful, robust hardware will be absolutely neccessary.  textbf{TRIWAVE SYSTEMS} has chosen to develop a proof of concept using 2.4GHz radio modules to reduce costs, before upgrading the system to using Ultra Wide Band (UWB) modules for further prototyping. Microcontroller Units (MCUs) will be used to control the beacons and ID tags. This is obviously an important role to play in the system and these requirements are meant to reflect the importance of using quality components that suit the needs of the product.

\subsection{Electrical Requirements}
In order for this product to be reliable, the electrical systems must be robust and efficient. \textbf{TRIWAVE SYSTEMS} has compiled a strict set of requirements that ensures the beacons and ID tags will stay powered for the maximum amount of time. In an emergency, it is important that the system does not change its operation, whether the building's power is working or not. With these requirements \textbf{TRIWAVE SYSTEMS} has ensured that there is a sufficient amount of power going to each device at any time, and is ready to switch from idle mode to emergency mode at any time.

\subsection{Software Requirements}
In order for  \textbf{TRIWAVE SYSTEMS} to properly develop a proof of concept of this product, a strong back end of software needs to be developed. This starts with the use of trilateration at a frequency of 2.4GHz to locate a single ID tag. As this product progresses, communication with the server must be done in an efficient manner, and a User Interface (UI) must be developed that is easy to use and conveys important information quickly.
