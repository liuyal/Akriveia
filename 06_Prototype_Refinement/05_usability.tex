\subsection{Hardware Usability}

Simple design and implementation from a hardware perspective is important for a product meant to be used in emergencies. On the ID tags, a simplistic switch is used to activate the device. There is no access to the internal components, so that it cannot be tampered with. For the beacons, the containment of the internal components will not be permanent and inaccessible like the ID tags, and will allow for hardware maintenance if needed. The sliding lid will be locked into place, accessible only by authorized personnel. Once unlocked, the lid will slide open easily to allow simple access to internal components.
