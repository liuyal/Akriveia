\section{Human Factors \& Usability}

\bigskip
Hardware components are designed and implemented with usability and serviceability in mind. It is curial for the product to be intuitively to use since it is meant to be used in emergency situations. On 
ID tags, a simple toggle switch is used to activate and deactivate the device. The switch is labelled by text, a simple color scheme, and LEDs indicating on and off state. Access to internal components is restricted to discourage unwanted tampering. For beacons, similar measures with color scheme and LEDS are used to indicate device power state. The internal components will not be permanently inaccessible like ID tags, and will be allowed for maintenance if needed. The beacon casing provides a sliding lid which can be locked into place to prevent tampering, as accessible will only be allowed by authorized personnel.  Once unlocked, the lid can slide open to allow easy access to internal circuitry and components.
