The Akriveia Beacon by TRIWAVE SYSTEMS focuses on improving the locating and rescue process of personnels trapped in buildings during or after small scale disasters such as fires and low magnitude earthquakes. This is achieved by incorporating a combination of advanced Ultra-wide-band radio modules, micro-controller units and data processing server to create a dependable indoor positioning system using reliable trilateration techniques. Akriveia Beacon allows search and rescue operations to safely and reliably locate victims during and after an emergency or disaster. By pinpointing the exact location of any victim wearing an ID tag, this minimizes the search and rescue time for rescue operators; which is crucial during the time period right after a disaster strikes.

This document addresses the functional and non-functional requirements for Akriveia Beacon: The Indoor Location Rescue System created by TRIWAVE SYSTEMS. From this document, the reader will be able to obtain a full understanding of the functions and higher-level system design of the Akriveia Beacon. The specifications details system components, and requirements for each specified domains. Additionally, aspects of engineering standards, responsibilities, safety, and sustainability (C2C \cite{R25}) of this project are outlined to provide an overview for practices followed by the engineers at TRIWAVE SYSTEMS.

\bigskip
TRIWAVE SYSTEMS is dedicated to creating a reliable and robust system for disaster search and rescue operations with human safety as the pivotal focus.
