\section*{Abstract}	
\medskip
The Akrivia Beacon by TRIWAVE SYSTEMS focuses on improving the locating and rescue process of personnels trapped in buildings during or after small scale disasters such as fires and low magnitude earthquakes. This is achieved by incorporating an combination of advanced Ultra-wide-band radio modules, microcontroller units and data processing server to create an dependable indoor positioning system using reliable trilateration techniques. Akrivia Beacon allows search and rescue operations to safely and reliably locate victims during and after an emergency or disaster. By pinpointing the exact location of any victim wearing an ID tag, this allows rescue operators minimizing the search and rescue time; which is crucial during the time period right after a disaster strikes.

\bigskip
This document addresses the functional and nonfunctional requirements for Akrivia Beacon - The Indoor Disaster Rescue System created by TRIWAVE SYSTEMS. From this document, the reader will be able to gain full understanding to the functions and higher-level system design of the Akrivia Beacon. The specifications details system components, and requirements for each specified domains. Additionally aspects of engineering standards, responsibilities, safety, and sustainability of this project are outlined to provide an overview for practices followed by the engineers at TRIWAVE SYSTEMS.

\bigskip
TRIWAVE SYSTEMS is dedicated to creating a reliable and robust system for disaster search and rescue operations with human safety as the pivotal focus.
