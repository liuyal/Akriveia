	\subsection{Project Scope}
	The location system should be:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reliable - physical conditions do not affect it
		\item Robust - human factors do not affect the success rate
		\item Simple - easy for a person to use or navigate
		\item Human beings must carry this device on themselves (Biggest Issue)
		\item System should work regardless of human factor (ie. people not wearing the device)
	\end{itemize}
