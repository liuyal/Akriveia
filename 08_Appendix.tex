\subsection{Proof Of Concept(PoC) Acceptance Test Plan}

% What testing is there supposed to be?
The PoC Acceptance Test Plan includes all the testing procedures for verifying and validating the requirement specifications under a formal test environment. The goal of the PoC Acceptance Test Plan is to ensure the basic requirements stated in the \textbf{\textit{System Requirements}} section of the document are met.

\medskip
Three main goals for the PoC testing are as follows:

\begin{enumerate} 
    \item 2.4 GHz chips are able to receive and transmit data accurately
    \item Arduino micro-controllers(MCU) receives the transmission data 
    \item Raspberry Pi receives data serially from Arduino MCU
\end{enumerate}

%The acceptance test plan will consists of the test below:
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item System(General) Tests
%    \item Hardware Tests
%    \item Electrical Tests
%    \item Software Tests
%    \item Software - UI Tests
%    \item Performance Tests
%    \item Performance - Signal Tests
%\end{enumerate}
% Acceptance Test Plan is Long
